    "An _endomorphism_ of S is any map from S to itself. The set of all endomorphisms of S is denoted $E_S$. The structure composed of a set and one of its endomorphisms is isomorphic to a graph whose nodes represent the points of S and with an arc from a to b if and only if $f(a)=b$. \n",

    "\n",
    "Maps of depth zero are the _automorphisms_ of S, better known as _permutations_. If $f$ has depth $n$, then we shall use the symbol $P_f$ to denote the image $S_n$. The points of $P_f$ are central to the description of $f$, since the restriction of $f$ to $P_f$ is a permutation, the _core_ of $f$. Usually we can drop the subscript $f$ and write $P$ instead of $P_f$.\n",

    "It is easy to see that each point of S is connected to exactly one cycle. The set consisting of the points of a cycle together with all the transients connected to it is termed a _component_ (of $f$ on S). The components provide a complete partition of S into disjoint subsets.\n",

    "We may define a kind of inverse for an endomorphism - take the associated graph, and reverse all the arrows. We shall denote this _reverse_ of $f$ by the symbol $f^*$. When $f$ is a permutation the reverse corresponds to the algebraic inverse of the permutation, but in all other cases $f^*$ is not even a mapping of S to itself. Instead it is a mapping from S to the set of subsets of S (its _powerset_).\n",
